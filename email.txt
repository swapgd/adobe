Subject: Update on Social Ad Campaign Automation - Temporay delay in Asset Delivery


Dear Jon Doe,

I wanted to inform you of a short delay in the creative asset delivery for your upcoming campaign.

Whatâ€™s Happening:

- Our automation system is currently experiencing a provisioning delay with the GenAI API licensing.
- As a result, generation of some creative variants is running slower than expected.

Impact:

- A subset of campaign assets may be delivered later than the originally scheduled timeline.
- Most assets are unaffected and remain on track, so your team can begin using those immediately.

Next Steps

- We are actively working with the provider to resolve the licensing issue.
- We will queued all pending generation tasks so they will process automatically once access is restored.

We expect the outstanding assets to be ready within the next 10-12 hours.

Completed assets have passed all brand and compliance checks.
We will continue to keep you updated until the campaign set is fully ready.

Thank you for your patience and understanding as we address this dependency. 
Please let me know if you have any concern or suggestion, happy to get on call and discuss in detail.

Best,
Swapnil
